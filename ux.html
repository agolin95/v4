    I majored in Computer Science and Human Factors Engineering at Tufts and in some of my free time I worked for Tufts Technology Services in the Academic Technology division as an "AT Fellow." There, I worked on unique technical problems to help the academic staff of Tufts better interface with students and present their lesssons. I began working as a Software Engineer at Pegasystems on the data vizualization team. We worked in several languanges ranging from Java to TypeScript to graphical coding interfaces in order to enhance the reporting and visualization capabilities of Pega. Additionally, over the years I have done several freelance and personal projects.
