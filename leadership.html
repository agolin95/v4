      <h1>Leadership</h1>
      <p>
        I believe the only true form of leadership is servant leadership. It isn't about power, it's about people - individuals with whom we can form meaningful connections and navigate life together. In college and in my career I've sought out leadership roles that have enabled me to foster communities that drive a sense of belonging and purpose predicated on shared values and open minded communication.

      <p>
        After an internship and 8 month stint as a full time developer on the data visualization team, an opportunity arose for me to become a scrum master - I jumped immediately. I serve two teams of roughly 7 people each, and it has been a wonderful opportunity to better understand how people work together and what each of us can very actively do to foster a postive team environment. It's my perogative and pleasure to advocate for my people within and beyond the team level, and so I've been exposed to many machinations of a global corporation and it's upper management. While I am indeed fascinated with process and management theory, the true value I see in being a scrum master lies in advocating for my people and the resultant sense of community and comaradarie I get to facilitate and enjoy with my teams.
