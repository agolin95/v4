    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I grew up in Manhattan where I attended Hunter College Elementary and High Schools. In class, I worked to balance my appreciation and love for both the arts and sciences, and I spent my free time playing guitar, singing, and acting in plays. I sought working experience as soon as I was able to, and applied myself to service jobs as a lifeguard in Pennsylvania, then as a server & barback in lower Manhattan. I graduated from high school in 2013.

        I went to Tufts University in Somerville, MA, where I double majored in Human Factors Engineering and Computer Science in hopes of combining my appreciation for design, psychology, and technology. In my free time, I managed the school radio statio and the DIY concert booking clubs to fulfill my musical passions and gain applied leadership experience. I also worked as a UX researcher and front-end developer for Tufts’ Technology Services for several years. I graduated from college in 2017.

        Immediately after graduating, I began working full time at Pegasystems, in Cambridge, MA, as a developer on the data visualization team, which I’d been a part of as an intern the summer before. I quickly set my sights on becoming a scrum master, eager to become a servant leader to improve coworkers’ work life and implement large scale change. In 2018 I began scrum mastering for two development teams while also operating as a member of the global Agile team, whose mission is to improve company-wide processes and operations while fostering a fun and enriching office culture.

    <p>
        I want to help people. I want to support the arts in any way possible. I want to harness burgeoning technology for ethical good. I want to combine my passions to unlock new avenues for societal progress and equality.
